The commenting style I typed and planned out in one of my google docs, hopefully to keep comments consistant.

=-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-= =-=



/* (name of file this code is in) description:
* (description of what the file does, and the importance and existence of the code that’s in here.)
*/


// COMMENTS IN ALL CAPS ARE TO NOT BE PERMANENT, AND INSTEAD SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO TEMPORARILY ALERT A DEV (PROBABLY MYSELF) TO COME BACK TO A THING OR AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WITH SHOULD BE RESOLVED ASAP, AND THEN BE DELETED.


// This code does a thing.
code(code);
code(code, 1, 2, 3);


/* (what this comment block is about)
* (stuff in the comment block)
*/


// And this does a thing, too.
code(code); //No initial space in this comment
code(code, 1, 2, 3); //(code input, runtime, always use 2, age of cereal)
